## Scenario: Addressing Community Empowerment & Development

### Problem
A local community struggles with low participation in development initiatives, lack of skill-building opportunities, and poor communication among members, leading to slow progress in achieving collective goals.

---

## Solution Using the Tool

- **Task Assignment**: Community leaders assign tasks such as organizing workshops, skill-building sessions, and awareness campaigns to volunteers and members.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates on completed workshops, skill-building activities, and community events are shared.
- **Community Participation**: Members can suggest ideas, report issues, and collaborate on projects through the platform.
- **Impact Measurement**: The tool tracks improvements in community engagement, skill development, and overall progress toward development goals.

## Technology Stack

This project is built using the **MERN stack**:
- **MongoDB**: For database management.
- **Express.js**: For backend server operations.
- **React.js**: For the frontend user interface.
- **Node.js**: For server-side runtime environment.

The project also incorporates **SDG (Sustainable Development Goals)** principles and **Design Thinking** concepts to ensure a user-centric and impactful solution.

**Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up the project locally and run the Community-Based Task Management Tool:

**Prerequisites**
Node.js (v18 or higher) and npm installed.

MongoDB installed locally or a cloud instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

**Git for cloning the repository.**

Setup Instructions
**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/Akshayaa139/Actionhub.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**

cd Actionhub 

**Set up the Frontend:**

Move to the frontend directory:

cd action  

**Install dependencies:**

npm install  

**Start the React frontend:**

npm start  

The frontend will open at http://localhost:3000.

**Set up the Backend:**

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the backend directory from the root folder:

cd backend  


**Configure MongoDB:**

Ensure MongoDB is running locally (start the service with mongod or via your OSâ€™s system manager).

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your MongoDB connection URI:


MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/actionhub  
PORT=5000  

**Start the backend server:**

node server.js  
The backend will run at http://localhost:5000.

**Verify the Setup:**

Ensure both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 5000) servers are running.

**Access the application via** http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

**Notes**
Replace the MONGODB_URI in .env with your MongoDB Atlas URI if using a cloud database.

Seed data or initial setup scripts can be added to MongoDB using tools like Compass or the mongo shell.

**Troubleshooting**
**Dependency Errors**: Run npm install in both action and backend directories.

**MongoDB Connection Issues**: Ensure the MongoDB service is active and the URI in .env is correct.

**Port Conflicts**: Change PORT in .env for the backend or adjust the React script for the frontend.

Congratulations! The Community-Based Task Management Tool is now running locally. Collaborate, assign tasks, and track progress seamlessly! ðŸš€
